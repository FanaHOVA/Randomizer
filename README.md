EZ Randomizer
==========

The script was inspired by r/CSGOBetting; I've found myself being torn on picking a team to bet on sometimes and wanted to randomize my pick. The Helix Fossil doesn't care about the odds of the team, nor does the 8 ball. With this script the odds of a team winning are taken into account before giving the output.

Odds-wise this script is the equivalent of rolling a dice with 100 faces that can display either A or B. The number of faces isn't equally divided though, the favored team (A) will have X face with his letter on it, while the underdog will only have 100-X. 

Good luck with your betting!

Ez skins, ez life.
